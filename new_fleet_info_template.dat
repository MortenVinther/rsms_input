####### survey options ###### 
 #      Fleet name
 # 1:   Use the fleet asssessment, 1=yes, 0=no
 # 2:   Index type and input:
 #        1 = Effort and index catch in numbers by age;
 #        2 = Effort and index for total exploitable biomass, (including all ages with F>0);
 #        3 = Effort and index for toal spawning stock biomass;
 #        4 = Commercial effort used with the assumption that Effort is a proxy for F at age;
 #        5 = Commercial effort used with the assumption that Effort is a proxy for Fbar ;
 # 3-4:  First and last year
 # 5:    Season for survey, use 1 for annual data
 # 6.7:  Alpha and beta - the start and end of the survey period for the fleet given as fractions of the season
 #                  (or of the year if annual data are used)
 # 8-9:  First and last age, use -1 if not relevant
 # 10:    Last age is a plus group? (0=no, 1=yes)
 # 11:   Last age for stock size dependent catchability (power model), -1 shows no ages uses power model
 # 12:   Technical creep in effort (only used for type 4 index)
 # 13:   Number  of cathability groups
 #         First ages in group of ages  for estimates of catcahability at age
 #       Number of variance of cathability groups
 #         First ages in group of ages  for estimates of variance of catcahability at age
 #       Check value (must be -999)
